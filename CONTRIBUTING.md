## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+ (for npm package)
- Docker (optional)
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/computer-use-mcp.git
cd computer-use-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Install in editable mode

# Install dev dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov black pylint mypy
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_safety.py

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -v tests/
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/ tests/

# Lint with pylint
pylint src/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy src/

# Run all checks
make lint  # If Makefile is available
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use Black for formatting (line length: 88)
- Add type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all public functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or fixes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(tools): add double-click support to click tool
fix(safety): prevent command injection in type tool
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies

Example test structure:
```python
def test_feature_normal_case():
    """Test feature works in normal conditions"""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert

def test_feature_edge_case():
    """Test feature handles edge cases"""
    # ...

def test_feature_error_handling():
    """Test feature handles errors gracefully"""
    # ...
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to new code
- Update API documentation
- Include examples for new features
- Keep documentation in sync with code
