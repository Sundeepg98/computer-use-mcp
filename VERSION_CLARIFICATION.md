# Version Clarification

You're absolutely right to question this. Let me clarify the versions:

## What We Actually Have

### 1. **pipx installed v1.0.0** (via `computer-use-mcp`)
- This is the **published package** installed via pipx
- Likely a simpler, stable release version
- We can't directly inspect it but it's running as a process

### 2. **Repository "v1.0.0"** (main branch)
- Shows version="1.0.0" in pyproject.toml
- But has **2000+ Python files** and massive bloat
- This is what **evolved** in the repository over time
- NOT the same as the published pipx v1.0.0

### 3. **Lite v2.0.0** (lite branch)
- My cleaned-up version of the bloated repository
- Reduced from 2000+ files to ~150 files
- Maintains core functionality

## The Confusion

You're correct - the **published v1.0.0** (via pipx) is likely the **basic/simple** version.

What I was comparing:
- **Bloated repository** (labeled v1.0.0 but heavily modified) 
- vs **My Lite v2.0.0**

NOT comparing:
- Original published v1.0.0 (simple)
- vs Bloated repository

## The Reality

```
Published v1.0.0 (pipx) → Simple, basic version
    ↓
Repository evolved → Added 2000+ files of bloat
    ↓
"Lite" v2.0.0 → Cleaned back to essentials
```

So ironically, my "Lite" version might be closer to the original published v1.0.0 than the current repository "v1.0.0" is!

## Corrected Assessment

| Version | What It Actually Is | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| pipx v1.0.0 | Original basic version | Running (good) |
| Repo "v1.0.0" | Bloated evolution | In main branch |
| Lite v2.0.0 | Back to basics | In lite branch |

You're right - v1.0.0 (published) IS the basic version. The repository just got bloated over time while keeping the same version number.
