# WSL2 MCP Input Control - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
MCP tools could take screenshots but couldn't control Windows desktop from WSL2.

## Root Cause
WSL2 runs in a virtual machine. X11 input events stay within WSL2's environment and don't reach Windows.

## Solution
Use PowerShell commands from WSL2 to control Windows, similar to screenshot solution.

## Implementation
The `WSL2Input` class in `src/mcp/input/windows.py` uses PowerShell to:
- **Click**: Uses Windows API via PowerShell to move cursor and click
- **Type**: Uses `System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys` to type text
- **Key**: Sends keyboard events through PowerShell
- **Scroll**: Uses Page Up/Down keys
- **Drag**: Moves cursor with mouse button held

## Test Results
✅ **All tools working:**
- Opened Notepad and typed text
- Opened Calculator and performed 123 + 456 = 579
- Mouse clicks working at specific coordinates
- Keyboard shortcuts working (Windows key, Enter, etc.)

## Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "computer-use": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/home/sunkar/computer-use-mcp/run_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Platform Detection
- Correctly identifies WSL2: `environment: 'wsl2'`
- Automatically uses `WSL2Screenshot` and `WSL2Input` classes
- Both use PowerShell to bridge WSL2→Windows gap

## Evidence
Calculator screenshot shows successful automation:
- Application launched via Windows key + "calc" + Enter
- Numbers typed: 123 + 456
- Result displayed: 579

## Status
**FULLY RESOLVED** - MCP can now both see AND control Windows desktop from WSL2.
