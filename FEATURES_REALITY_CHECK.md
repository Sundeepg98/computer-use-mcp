## Feature Quality Assessment

### Basic v1.0.0
- **9 features, 100% work**
- Simple, reliable
- Everything you need

### Bloated Version
- **9 features work, 10+ broken/fake**
- Lots of complexity
- Same functionality as Basic
- Added broken experiments

### Lite v2.0.0
- **7 features, 100% work**
- Removed platform/display info (rarely needed)
- Core functionality intact
- Better security

## The Shocking Reality

**All three versions do essentially the same thing!**

The bloated version just added:
1. Broken features that don't work
2. Fake features that lie
3. Documentation disguised as features
4. Complexity without functionality

## Which Has More USEFUL Features?

| Rank | Version | Working Features | Why |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| 1st | Basic v1.0.0 | 9 | All features work |
| 2nd | Lite v2.0.0 | 7 | Core features + security |
| 3rd | Bloated | 9 (+ 10 broken) | Same as Basic + junk |

## Bottom Line

**No feature advantage in bloated version.**
- Basic has 9 working features
- Bloated has same 9 + broken attempts
- Lite has 7 core features

The bloated version is literally just Basic + failed experiments.
