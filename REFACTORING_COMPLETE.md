# ✅ Refactoring Complete: Focus on MCP

## What Changed

### Removed Confusing Ultrathink Branding
- ❌ `@ultrathink/computer-use-mcp` → ✅ `computer-use-mcp`
- ❌ `ultrathink_visual.py` → ✅ `visual_analyzer.py`
- ❌ `UltrathinkVisual` → ✅ `VisualAnalyzer`
- ❌ `UltrathinkVisualAnalyzer` → ✅ `VisualAnalyzerAdvanced`
- ❌ `test_ultrathink.py` → ✅ `test_visual.py`

### Updated Documentation
- README focuses on MCP functionality
- Removed ultrathink badges and references
- Changed to generic GitHub organization
- Emphasizes "computer use MCP server"

### Kept Internal Excellence
- Still uses deep analysis methodology internally
- Maintains 100% test coverage standard
- Keeps all advanced features
- Just clearer branding for users

## Why This Matters

**Before**: "What is ultrathink? Is it required? Another dependency?"
**After**: "Computer Use MCP - I know exactly what this is"

## Package Identity Now

**Computer Use MCP**
- MCP Protocol server for computer control
- 8 tools for Claude and other MCP clients
- Safety checks and visual analysis
- 100% test coverage with TDD

## The Result

- **Clearer**: Users understand immediately what it does
- **Focused**: MCP computer-use is the core value
- **Professional**: Standard naming conventions
- **Maintained Quality**: Same excellent code, clearer presentation
