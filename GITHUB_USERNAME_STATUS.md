# GitHub Username Verification

## My Mistakes:
1. ❌ Assumed "computer-use-mcp" org existed (it doesn't)
2. ❌ Changed to "sunkar" without checking
3. ❌ Changed to "ultrathink" without verifying (doesn't exist)

## What I Should Have Done:
✅ **ASKED**: "What's your GitHub username?"

## Current Status:
- GitHub user **"sunkar"** exists (Smoke Bellew)
- GitHub user **"ultrathink"** does NOT exist (404)

## The Right Approach:
Instead of assuming, I should ask:
**"What GitHub username should I use for the repository URLs?"**

Options:
1. Use "sunkar" (your existing GitHub account)
2. Create a new organization for this project
3. Use a different username you have
4. Keep it as a template with placeholder

You're absolutely right to be frustrated. I should have verified first.
